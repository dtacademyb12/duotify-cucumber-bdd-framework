BDD - (Behavior Driven Development) - set of practices that facilitate the communication between technical and non-technical memebers
      through feature files and scenarios written in plain english using Gherkin syntax


Steps to create Cucumber BDD framework:

1. Create a new Maven project and add the following cucumber dependencies and any other required ones:
     <dependency>
            <groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
            <artifactId>cucumber-java</artifactId>
            <version>7.14.0</version>
        </dependency>

        <dependency>
            <groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
            <artifactId>cucumber-junit</artifactId>
            <version>7.14.0</version>
            <scope>test</scope>
        </dependency>

        <dependency>
            <groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
            <artifactId>cucumber-core</artifactId>
            <version>7.14.0</version>
        </dependency>
2. Create framework package structure: pages, runners, stepDefinitions, utils in src/test/java, features in src/test/resources
3. Add necessary utility classes, .gitignore, .properties file
4. Add a new feature file that represents a single feature, this usually corresponds to a user story
5. Add scenarios in the feature file that correspond to a test case.
6. Add a runner class that runs the scenarios. This class is typically an empty class annotrated with @RunWith(Cucumber.class)
   The runner class needs to have the minimum configurations for the location of features files and step definition files with @CucumberOptions
  @CucumberOptions (
          features = "src/test/resources/features", // path where feature files are located
          glue = "stepDefinitions" // path where step definitions are located
  )
7. Run the specific scenario. When you run the scenario the first time, Cucumber generates a step definition snippets for each unimplemented step.
    To run the specific scenario, we need to add a tag on the sceanrio, and mention the tag in @CucumberOptions
8. Add the generated step definition snippets into a specific Step definition class in stepdefinitions folder and implement the actual logic for each step.
9. Re-Run the scenario and verify the correctness




Background -> the common steps for ALL scenarios of a feature file can be moved to Background steps

Hooks -> Step definition methods annotated with @Before and @After that are executed before/after each SCENARIO
             The annotated methods can be added into any class under Step Definitions folder but usually added into a separate class
  - Cucumber offers 3 types of Hooks: @BeforeAll, @AfterAll, @Before, @After, @BeforeStep, @AfterStep

How Cucumber Background is different from Hook?
1. Purpose: Hook is used for configuration logic whereas Background is used for test logic
2. Scope: Hook is applicable to all scenarios whereas Background is applicable only to scenarios within a single feature file



Reporting in Cucumber Framework
- Cucumber comes with its own built-in HTML report. To enable it, we need to add the HTML plugin with the path to the file in @CucumberOptions
   e.g    plugin = {"html:target/basic-report/report.html"}

How did you implement taking a screenshot on failure in Cucumber?
- In @After hook, we used Scenario class and checked if scenario is failed, and took a screenshot with Selenium and attached the scrrenshot file with Scenario class's attach method.
  e.g. public void tearDownScenario(Scenario scenario){
          if(scenario.isFailed()){
              scenario.attach(((TakesScreenshot) Driver.getDriver()).getScreenshotAs(OutputType.BYTES), "image/png", "screenshot");
          }
    }



How do you run your scenarios through CMD in Cucumber framework?
- Using Maven Surefire plugin and mvn test command
    e.g.
    <build>
            <pluginManagement>
                <plugins>
                    <plugin>
                        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                        <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
                        <version>3.0.0</version>
                        <configuration>
                           <includes>
                               <include>CucumberRunner.java</include>
                           </includes>
                        </configuration>
                    </plugin>
                </plugins>
            </pluginManagement>
        </build>



How to run scenarios with specific tag/s through CMD in Cucumber?

mvn test -D cucumber.filter.tags="@positive"
mvn test -D cucumber.filter.tags="@positive and @smoke"
mvn test -D cucumber.filter.tags="@positive or @smoke"

When you pass the tags through CMD with -D cucumber.filter.tags, it will override the Runner class's tags.


Lombok is used to reduce boilerplate code for classes, e.g., it can generate getters and setters for those objects automatically by using Lombok annotations.
The easiest way is to use the @Data annotation.
In our Framework we used Lombok annotation @Data for our Page classes to automatically generate getter methods to be accessible outside in our Test code.


DocString

If you need to specify information in a scenario that won't fit on a single line, you can use a DocString. (""" """)
       When you use a doctring make sure to put each triple quote on its own line.
       Ex: Scenario: Example scenario for Database
           When I send the following query
             """
                select first_name,last_name,email,address,district,city,country from customer
                join address
                on customer.address_id = address.address_id
                join city
                on address.city_id  = city.city_id
                join country
                on city.country_id = country.country_id;
              """


What cucumber exceptions do you know?

UndefinedStepException - when a scenario step is unimplemented
PendingException - default exception added to each snippet
DuplicateStepDefinitionException - when there are more than one exactly matching step definitions for a single step
AmbiguousStepDefinitionsException - when there are more than one matching step definitions due to cucumber expressions ambiguity
CucumberException - when cucumber can not convert datatable to a corresponding java type indicated in step def argument
 Example:
 And I want to buy "socks" -> matches the following step defs:
                     @And("I want to buy {string}")
                     @And("I want to buy {word}")
