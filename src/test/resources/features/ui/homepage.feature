Feature: Music Streaming App Homepage

  As a music lover, I want to be able to access and explore music easily through a music streaming app. The homepage of the app should display 9 albums on the main page and have a left sidebar with links to Search, Browse, Your Music, and Edit User profile options.

  Background:
    When the user enters a valid email and password
    And the user clicks on the login button
    Then the user should be directed to their personal dashboard

  Scenario: User opens the app and sees certain number of recommended albums on the homepage
    Then the user should see 9 recommended albums displayed on the main page



  Scenario: User clicks on the Your Music link in the sidebar
    When the user clicks on the "Your Music" link in the sidebar
    Then the user should be able to access their personal music library, where they can view, create, edit and delete playlists.

  Scenario Outline: User clicks on the Search link in the sidebar

    @albumNames
    Scenario: Verify all album names
#      Then the recommended album names should be "Cruel Summer" "Clouds" "Marisa"
#      Datatable is a way to pass complex data structure(List, Map) into a single step
      Then the recommended album names should be
        | Cruel summer        |
        | Clouds              |
        | Marisa              |
